### Hi. Want some coffee ? ☕
I'm Khanh, a mediocre dev with a big desire. I'm deeply interested in building, deploying systems, tinkering with new stuff (AI, distributed systems, ...), and just like to have things work.

I'm pretty confident in a variety of technologies and tools:
- 🔭 Writing code in Python, Golang and related frameworks (FastAPI, Pytorch, Mux, ...)
- 🔭 Building systems, working with databases & services
- 🔭 Configuring cloud services & home-labs

### What I'm working on
- Job: currently an intern, working with blockchain application & systems
- Personal: trying to build a high-performance system for real-time / high-load scenarios. Using distributed databases, messages brokers, caching and some other things. **And keep learning.**
