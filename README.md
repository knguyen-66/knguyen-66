### Hi there. Small talk incoming â˜•
I'm Khanh, a dev geek. I'm deeply interested in building, deploying systems, tinkering with new stuff (AI, distributed systems, ...), and just like to make things work.

I can be decent in a variety of technologies and toolkits:
- ðŸ”­ Writing code in Python, Golang and related frameworks (FastAPI, Pytorch, Mux, ...)
- ðŸ”­ Building not-a-single-user-traffic systems, working with databases & (micro)services
- ðŸ”­ Configuring cloud services & home labs

### What I'm working on
- Job: currently a DevOps intern, building internal-use applications for monitoring hardware changes
- Personal: building a platform for people to design their own chatbot with their data (update: scratched that shit, too suck). **And keep learning.**
