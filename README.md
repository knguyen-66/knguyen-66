### Hi there. Just a short intro â˜•
I'm Khanh, a developer with a big desire. I'm deeply interested in building, deploying systems, tinkering with new stuff (AI, distributed systems, ...), and just like to make things work.

I'm pretty confident in a variety of technologies and tools:
- ðŸ”­ Writing code in Python, Golang and related frameworks (FastAPI, Pytorch, Mux, ...)
- ðŸ”­ Building systems, working with databases & services
- ðŸ”­ Configuring cloud services & home-labs

### What I'm working on
- Job: currently a DevOps intern, building internal-use application for managing team machines
- Personal: building a platform for people to design their own chatbot with their data. **And keep learning.**
